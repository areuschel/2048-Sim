# 2048-Sim
Simulation study testing 2048 game outcomes with varying strategies and new tile generation probabilities.

## Project Description

The game 2048 was a staple of my childhood, one of the few non-blocked games I could play on a middle school Chromebook. I still play the game today, using it often to pass time during long commutes in the city. Although the game's primary goal is the 2048 tile, I've been able to reach the 4096 tile, and further iterations are possible.

#### üìç Study Goal
My simulation study aims to learn how different strategies perform as the probability of generating a new tile with the value ‚Äò2‚Äô changes. I explore 4 strategies and compare their performance at each tile generation setting by investigating the game score, final board, and total number of moves made.
- See 'About 2048' section below to learn the rules if you are unfamiliar with the game.

## About 2048

### Game Origin

### Rules and Playing the Game

The game is played on a 4x4 tile board, where tile numbers increase as identical numbers are combined. Two tiles with the value ‚Äò2‚Äô spawn in random places to start the game, and a new tile is generated each time you move in any cardinal direction. The new tile that generates with each move is either a ‚Äò2‚Äô or a ‚Äò4‚Äô. The game continues until the entire board is full of tiles and none of them can be combined by a move in any direction. 

The default settings of the game have the probability of generating a ‚Äò2‚Äô at 90% and generating a ‚Äò4‚Äô at 10% for new tiles.

### Generate Starting Board

### Horizontal and Lateral Movements with Merges

### New Tile Random Generation

### Implemented Strategies for Simulation Study
First, a strategy where each move is chosen randomly. This was the simplest to begin with. I then test two repetitive strategies: one where the preferred move sequence is ‚Äòdown-left-down-left‚Äô and another that switches between ‚Äòleft-right-left-right‚Äô and ‚Äòup-down-up-down‚Äô. For both of these strategies, if the next move in the sequence doesn‚Äôt change the board, a random move is selected to continue the game before returning to the original sequence. Lastly, I attempt to simplify my own strategy to the game.
